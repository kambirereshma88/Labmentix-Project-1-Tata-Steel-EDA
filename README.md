Tata Steel EDA Analysis

Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Tata Steel dataset. The goal is to identify key insights related to machine failures, operational efficiency, and process improvements using statistical analysis and visualizations.

Dataset Details
The dataset contains machine sensor readings and failure records.
Key features include air temperature, process temperature, rotational speed, torque, tool wear, and machine failure status.
The data was cleaned and processed to remove missing values, handle outliers, and analyze correlations.
Analysis Performed
Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and duplicate records.
Performed outlier detection and removal.
Standardized and normalized necessary variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized missing values using heatmaps.
Analyzed distributions of key variables.
Used correlation heatmaps to identify relationships.
Studied machine failure patterns using bar charts and scatter plots.
Key Visualizations & Insights:

Distribution of air temperature and process temperature.
Machine failure frequency across different conditions.
Relationship between torque, rotational speed, and failures.
Impact of tool wear on failures.
Power consumption trends over time.

Business Impact
The analysis helps in predictive maintenance by identifying failure-prone conditions.
Optimizing machine performance by adjusting operating parameters.
Reducing downtime and improving operational efficiency.


Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
